            <h2>What "Gifted" Looks Like in Georgia</h2>
            <p>The Georgia Department of Education (GaDOE) asks us to look for potential in four distinct areas. Our goal is to find students who demonstrate strength in these categories.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mental Ability:</strong> How students think, reason, and solve novel problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Achievement:</strong> What students have learned and mastered in core subjects like reading and math.</li>
                <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> How students generate unique, original, and elaborate ideas.</li>
                <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> A student's drive, curiosity, and desire to take on a challenge.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="presenter-note">A student doesn't have to be a top performer in all four areas. The state provides a couple of pathways for them to qualify.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
            <h2>The Path to Eligibility: Two Ways to Qualify</h2>
            <p>Eligibility is determined by meeting the score requirements on one of two state-approved pathways.</p>
            <div class="columns">
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>Pathway A</h3>
                    <p>For students with exceptionally high scores in <strong>two</strong> specific areas.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A qualifying score in <strong>Mental Ability</strong> (99th percentile for K-2, 96th for grades 3+).</li>
                        <li><strong>AND</strong> a qualifying score in <strong>Achievement</strong> (90th percentile or higher).</li>

                        <li>Qualifying scores in any <strong>three of the four</strong> categories (Mental Ability, Achievement, Creativity, or Motivation). The percentile cutoff is typically 90% or higher.</li>

            <h2>What Our Different Tools Measure</h2>
            <h3>For Achievement (What they've learned):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MAP Test:</strong> Our universal screener for reading and math skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Iowa Assessment:</strong> Another nationally-normed test that measures academic skill, just with a different format and structure than the MAP.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>For Mental Ability (How they think):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CogAT & Naglieri:</strong> These use puzzles and non-traditional problems to assess reasoning and problem-solving skills.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>For Creativity (How they generate ideas):</h3>
            <ul>
                 <li><strong>Torrance Test:</strong> Measures creative thinking skills like originality and elaboration.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>For Motivation (Their drive to learn):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Renzulli Scale:</strong> A rating scale where classroom teachers provide insight into a student's curiosity and persistence.</li>

                <li><strong>Familiarization, Not Studying:</strong> Help your child feel confident by familiarizing them with the <em>style</em> of questions. Think puzzles, logic, and "out-of-the-box" thinking. The goal is comfort, not cramming.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep it Low-Pressure:</strong> The best message is "Have fun and try your best!" Frame it as a chance to tackle some interesting new challenges.</li>
